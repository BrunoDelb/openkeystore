<h2>HTTP-based Security Proxy Framework</h2>
Sometimes is required to restrict sensitive resources from direct incoming
calls while still being able to handle external requests.  This
usually leads to the use of some kind of reverse proxy solution.  The
following Java library provides a minute proxy solution that is
designed for integration in applications.  That is, this is not a
tunnel scheme like SSH.  The illustration below shows a typical
configuration:

<h3><B>Features at a Glance</B></h3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>HTTP-based</I>.&nbsp;
	 Use long-hanging outgoing HTTP requests that either terminate and
	return after a predefined time, or return immediately when request
	data is found</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Speedy</I>.&nbsp;
	 Request latency is essentially a network &ldquo;roundtrip&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Network-friendly</I>.&nbsp;
	 When there are no incoming requests, the load on the network is
	negliable</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Authenticated</I>.&nbsp;
	 The proxy supports two-way TLS authentication using X.509
	certificates</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Self-healing</I>.&nbsp;
	 The proxy proxy channel is automatically restored in case of a
	network error or malfunction in any of the two end-points.  The
	inner service is notified if the outer service is restarted</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Bidirectional</I>.&nbsp;
	 Although the primary purpose of the proxy is catering for incoming
	requests, the same channel can also be used for &ldquo;upload&rdquo;
	of data that the outer service may need</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Java-centric</I>.&nbsp;
	 The proxy accepts requests that are based on serializable Java
	objects</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Load-configurable</I>.&nbsp;
	 The proxy enables you to define the maximum number of parallel HTTP
	&quot;workers&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Multi-serviceble</I>.&nbsp;
	  There may be multiple and entirely different proxy services
	running in the same JVM instance or JBoss application</P>

<p><h3><B>Secure Operation</B></p></h3>
<p>In order to achieve high security a number of steps should be considered.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt">
	<I>Filter incoming data</I>.&nbsp;
	 It is recommended verifying incoming data with respect to syntax so
	that malformed request data isn't forwared to the inner service.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt">
	<I>Pre-authenticate
	requests</I>.&nbsp;  If incoming requests must be authenticated, it is
	recommended performing pre-authentication in the outer service
	before transferring request data to the inner service.  The &quot;upload&quot;
	facility may be used for providing the outer service with
	information needed for pre-authentication.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left:20pt"><I>Discriminate ports</I>.&nbsp;
    The outer service and its proxy server channel are
	preferably bound to different HTTP ports.  This requires specific
	settings in &ldquo;server.xml&rdquo; in Tomcat or Jboss.</P>
<P><h3><B>Configuration</B></h3></P>
<P>The
security proxy requires a minimum of configuration data.  The proxy
